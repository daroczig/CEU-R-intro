### Jan 28 (140 min): [Models](https://github.com/daroczig/CEU-R-lab/blob/master/4.R)

* Revisiting GitHub integration in RStudio:
    1. Install git from https://git-scm.com/
    2. Install R from https://www.r-project.org/
    3. Install RStudio from https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/#Desktop
    4. Verify that in RStudio, you can see the path of the `git` executable binary in the Tools/Global Options menu's "Git/Svn" tab -- if not, then you might have to restart RStudio (if you installed git after starting RStudio) or installed git by not adding that to the PATH on Windows. Either way, browse the "git executable" manually (in some `bin` folder look for thee `git` executable file).
	5. Create an RSA key (optionally with a passphrase for increased security -- that you have to enter every time you push and pull to and from GitHub). Copy the public key and add that to you SSH keys on your GitHub profile.
    6. Create a new project choosing "version control", then "git" and paste the SSH version of the repo URL copied from GitHub in the pop-up -- now RStudio should be able to download the repo. If it asks you to accept GitHub's fingerprint, say "Yes".
    7. If RStudio/git is complaining that you have to set your identity, click on the "Git" tab in the top-right panel, then click on the Gear icon and then "Shell" -- here you can set your username and e-mail address in the command line, so that RStudio/git integration can work. Use the following commands:

	    ```
        $ git config --global user.name "Your Name"
        $ git config --global user.email "Your e-mail address"
		```
		
		Close this window, commit, push changes, all set.

* `data.table` exercises with the following dataset:

	```r
	set.seed(42)
	tx <- data.table(
        item   = sample(letters[1:3], 10, replace = TRUE),
        time   = as.POSIXct(as.Date('2016-01-01')) - runif(10) * 36*60^2,
        amount = rpois(10, 25))
	prices <- data.table(
        item  = letters[1:3],
        date  = as.Date('2016-01-01') - 1:2,
        price = as.vector(outer(c(100, 200, 300), c(1, 1.2))))
	items <- data.table(
        item   = letters[1:3],
       color  = c('red', 'white', 'red'),
      weight = c(2, 4, 2.5))
	```
    * filter for transactions with "b" items
	* filter for transactions with less than 25 items
	* filter for transactions with less then 25 "b" items
	* count the number of transactions for each items
	* count the number of transactions for each day
	* count the overall number of items sold on each day

* Further `data.table` examples on
    * left joins
    * transforming wide and long tables with `reshape2`
	* rolling and overlap joins

* ANOVA
* Crosstable
* Simpson's paradox

Datasets for the model examples:
* [height & weight dataset](http://bit.ly/BudapestBI-R-csv)
* [Bickel et al 1975](http://bit.ly/bickel-1975)

Further `data.table` exercises on the `nycflights13` dataset to practice for the exam:
* count the number of flights to LAX
* count the number of flights to LAX from JFK
* compute the average delay (in minutes) for flights from JFK to LAX
* which destination has the lowest average delay from JFK?
* plot the average delay to all destinations from JFK
* plot the distribution of all flight delays to all destinations from JFK
* compute a new variable in flights showing the week of day
* plot the number of flights per weekday
* create a heatmap on the number of flights per weekday and hour of the day (see `geom_tile`)
* merge the `airports` dataset to `flights` on the FAA airport code
* order the `weather` dataset by `year`, `month`, `day` and `hour`
* plot the average temperature at noon in `EWR` for each month based on the `weather` dataset
* aggregate the `weather` dataset and store as `daily_temperatures` to show the daily average temperatures based on the `EWR` records
* merge the `daily_temperatures` dataset to `flights` on the date
* do the above two steps on daily + hourly temperature averages
