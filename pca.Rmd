```{r download, echo = FALSE}
download.file('https://bit.ly/r-intro-nasa-backup', 'image.jpg', mode = 'wb')
```

So we got an image:

![](image.jpg)
There's a strange object in the sand .. and we want to better highlight that using some stats approach.

Let's import into R!

```{r}
library(jpeg)
img <- readJPEG('image.jpg')
```

Looking at the structure:

```{r}
str(img)
```

This seems to be a 3D array!

Checking on the first pixel:

```{r}
img[1, 1, ]

col <- do.call(rgb, as.list(img[1, 1, ]))
col

barplot(1, col = col)
```

Let's record image height and width as we will need later:

```{r}
dim(img)
h <- dim(img)[1]
w <- dim(img)[2]
```

Now we can transform the 3D array into a 2D table with `h`*`w` rows and 3 columns for the RGB values:

```{r}
img1d <- matrix(img, h * w)
str(img1d)
```

And we are ready to run principal component analysis!

```{r}
pca <- prcomp(img1d)
pca
summary(pca)
```

Recap on PCA: the rotation matrix is the the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix.

```{r}
pca$rotation
eigen(cov(img1d))$vectors
```

But probably more important to render this as an actual HTML table:

```{r}
knitr::kable(pca$rotation)
```

Or you could try to pass any R object to `pander` (if installed), as it automatically tries to render any R object in markdown:

```{r}
pander:::pander(pca)
```

Recap on PCA: how to get the actual scores?

```{r}
str(pca$x)
## multiply the standardized numbers by the weights
str(sweep(img1d, 2, colMeans(img1d)) %*% pca$rotation)
str(scale(img1d, scale = FALSE) %*% pca$rotation)
```

What are these components really?

```{r}
cor(pca$x[, 1], img1d)
cor(pca$x, img1d)
```

Maybe better to visualize these correlation coefficients as colors!

```{r}
extractColors <- function(x) rgb(x[1], x[2], x[3])
(colors <- apply(abs(pca$rotation), 2, extractColors))
pie(pca$sdev, col = colors, labels = colors)
```

Okay, enough playing with this .. what did we achieve? Let's redraw the original image with artificial colors based on the components:

```{r}
image(matrix(pca$x[, 1], h))
```

Maybe another component?

```{r}
image(matrix(pca$x[, 2], h))
```

Reduce to monochrome:

```{r}
image(matrix(pca$x[, 2], h), col = gray.colors(100))
```
